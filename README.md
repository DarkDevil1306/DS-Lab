<h3>Data Structure Laboratory 2021<br>
             Assignment – 1</h3>

BATCH: Hx Date: 06th September 2021 Due date: 13th September 2020
1. Write a program in C to find the third largest from the given
array of integers without sorting.
2. Given an array of n integers, write a C program for reversing the
contents of the array without using another array.
3. Write a C program to add and subtract two integers having at least
10 digits each.
4. Write a C program to find the frequency of a character present in
the text given in a file.
5. Write a program in C to represent a sparse matrix of order n x n
efficient way in respect of space.

<h3>Data Structure Laboratory 2021<br>
Assignment – 2 </h3>

BATCH: Hx Date: 13 th September 2021 Due date: 20 th September 2021

1. Write a method duplicate Stack that returns a new stack
containing the same elements and in the same order as the
stack specified in the parameter. The method should create a
new stack and fill it with the same data elements as the given
stack. (You do not need to duplicate the contents of the
elements.).Before the method finishes, it must restore the
contents of the original stack to its original state (same
contents in the same order).
2. Sort the given set of elements present in three stack data
structures and put them in a single stack, without using any
other variable.

<h3>Data Structure Laboratory 2021<br>
Assignment – 3 </h3>
1. Write a function duplicateStack() that returns a new stack containing unique
elements in the same order as the given stack specified in the parameter.
Example:
Suppose the stack contains the elements : 10, 12, 10, 15, 20, 10, 15, 20, 25
So the duplicate stack should contain the elements: 10, 12, 15, 20, 25
Once this stack is created, display the contents of the stack and form this
stack revert back to the original stack contents.

2. Sort the given set of elements present in three stack data structures and put
them in a single stack, without using any other variable.

3. The priority queue will be a collection of strings. Lexicographically smaller
strings should be considered higher priority than lexicographically larger ones.
For example, "ping" is higher priority than "pong", regardless of insertion order.

Design the following functions:
i) enqueue is used to insert a new element to the priority queue.
ii) extractMin returns the value of highest priority (i.e., lexicographically
smallest) element in the queue and removes it.
iii) merge unifies the queues and returns their union as a newqueue.

4. In road traffic maintenance we know the traffic signal is used. Depending
on the real time traffic a particular signal is made on/off for a few seconds. If
we have the traffic data available then write a program in C to manage the
traffic signal.

Consider there is a 5 road connector and you have to provide the signal for
each of the roads. Generate the time for each traffic between 10 to 20 sec
randomly and provide the signal for each of the roads one by one.
If for any reason one road is to be blocked then block that road and provide
the signal for remaining roads as earlier.
